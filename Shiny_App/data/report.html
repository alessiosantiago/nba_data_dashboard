        <h4>Data Collection:</h4>
        <p>
        The primary source of data that I chose for this project is the "NBA
        Team Per Game Stats" dataset obtained from Kaggle, which can be accessed
        via this
        <a
            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jpsdev/19802019-nba-team-stats?resource=download&amp;select=renamed_teams.csv"
            target="_blank"

        >
            link
        </a>
        and can be found in the references section at the bottom. The dataset
        contains the "Team Per Game" stats of NBA teams from 1980-2019 season,
        and includes data such as Points (PTS), Assists (AST), Steals (STL),
        Three-Pointers Made (3PM), and other key per game statistics. Out of all
        the columns, I chose to eliminate the ones that did not seem relevant to
        team performance and strategic gameplay in the NBA, like “minutes
        played”, “games played”, and “fouls per game”. The columns I chose aimed
        to provide insights into how these metrics have evolved over time and
        their potential impact on team success.

         <p>
        The Team Rank tab provides a comprehensive view of NBA team standings
        over the decades from 1980 to 2019 through a line plot. This interactive
        visualization, powered by Plotly and crafted using ggplot2 in R, allows
        users to select a specific team and adjust the timeline to explore how
        their ranking out of 30 evolved over different seasons. By interacting
        with the plot, users gain insights into the fluctuating performance of
        teams across various eras, identifying periods of dominance, rebuilding
        phases, and shifts in competitiveness. The use of ggplot2 facilitated
        the creation of these line plots, while Plotly enhanced these static
        plots into dynamic visualizations, enabling interactive exploration of
        team rankings. It was particularly interesting to note how the strength
        of teams has fluctuated over the years, with clear periods of dominance
        by certain teams in different eras like the Celtics, Bulls, and Lakers
        in the 80s-90s and my Golden State Warriors in the late half of the
        2010s. Additionally, the analysis revealed that every team has
        experienced phases of both high and low rankings, highlighting the
        cyclical nature of team performance in the NBA. This tool not only
        offers a historical perspective on team rankings but also serves as a

        <h4>Three Pointers:</h4>
         <p>
        The Three Point Shooting tab offers insights into three-point shooting
        statistics for NBA teams from 1980 to 2019. This interactive dashboard
        allows users to select a team and visualize the trends in three-pointers
        made (3PM) and attempted (3PA) over different seasons. The
        visualization, powered by Plotly and ggplot2, illustrates how every team
        has embraced the three-point revolution, adapting strategies to
        incorporate more three-point attempts into their gameplay. It was
        shocking for me to see that most teams in the 80s only attempted around
        one three pointer per game, while in 2019 most teams are attempting over
        30 per game. This evolution reflects a league-wide trend where teams and
        coaches have capitalized on the efficiency and strategic advantages
        offered by three-point shooting. The interactive features of Plotly
        enhance user engagement by enabling detailed exploration of historical
        data points, offering insights into the transformative impact of the
        three-point shot on NBA gameplay and strategy.

<div>
        <h4>Points Per Game: </h4>
        <p>
        The Points Per Game tab provides an in-depth examination of the
        league-wide distribution of points scored per game in the NBA, covering
        data from 1980 to 2019. This interactive dashboard allows users to
        select a specific year from the dropdown menu and visualize the
        distribution of PPG across all teams through dynamic boxplots. Utilizing
        Plotly and ggplot2, the visualization offers a detailed perspective on
        how PPG has evolved over different eras in NBA history. Each boxplot
        represents the distribution of points scored by teams in the chosen
        year, offering insights into scoring trends and disparities within the
        league. The integration of tooltips in Plotly enriches user interaction
        by providing comprehensive details for each data point, including
        team-specific PPG values and contextual information. The dashboard
        revealed significant trends in scoring patterns across decades. It was
        particularly surprising to observe that PPG averaged around the 105-115
        range in the 1980s and early 1990s, reflecting a high-scoring era in the
        NBA. However, starting from the mid 90s to the 2010s, there was a
        noticeable decline, with PPG dropping to the 95-100 range for a period.
        This trend began to reverse around 2014, coinciding with the rise of the
        three-point revolution catalyzed by teams like the Golden State Warriors
        and players like Stephen Curry and we saw it rise once again to the
        105-115 range. These findings show the transformative impact of
        strategic shifts in gameplay, such as the emphasis on three-point
        shooting, and overall scoring dynamics in the league. The dashboard not
        only offers historical insights into scoring trends but also serves as a
        valuable resource for analyzing the evolution of offensive strategies
        and their implications for team performance in the NBA.

        1980s-1990s:
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p lang="EN-US">
        In the early decades, Field Goal Percentage (FG%) emerged as a critical
        factor influencing team rankings. Teams with higher FG% tended to
        achieve better ranks, reflecting the importance of efficiency in
        scoring. The significance of Three-Pointers Made (3PM) was minimal
        during this period, while Two-Pointers Made (2PM) held substantial
        weight. Rebounds and Assists also played pivotal roles, indicating a
        strong emphasis on team play and offensive efficiency. Conversely,
        Steals, Blocks, and Turnovers showed negligible correlations with team
        rank, suggesting that defensive metrics were less crucial compared to
        offensive performance.

<div>
    <p lang="EN-US">
        During the transition into the new millennium, FG% continued to be a
        decisive factor in team rankings. Interestingly, both 3PM and 2PM were
        less influential, signaling a period where shot quality rather than
        total makes drove success. Steals became more significant, suggesting a
        shift towards a more defensively oriented era. Notably, Turnovers became
        more detrimental to team rankings compared to the previous decade,
        underscoring the growing importance of ball security. Points scored
        showed a less steep relationship with team rank, reinforcing the era's
        emphasis on defensive strategies and efficient scoring opportunities.

<div>
    <p lang="EN-US">
        Moving into the 2000s and 2010s, FG% remained a critical metric, but the
        rise of 3PM and 2PM indicated a shift towards a more balanced offensive
        approach. Free Throws (FT) and Rebounds exhibited decreased
        significance, while the impact of Assists notably diminished, suggesting
        a trend towards isolation-heavy playstyles led by individual star
        players like Kobe, Carmelo, and Tracy Mcgrady. Steals and Blocks became

    <p lang="EN-US">
        In the most recent decade, FG% continued to be a crucial determinant of
        team success. However, the prominence of 3PM surged, surpassing 2PM and
        FT in significance, indicating the widespread adoption of the
        three-point shot as a strategic advantage. Rebounds saw reduced
        importance, while Assists regained relevance, suggesting a return to
        team-oriented playstyles. Both Blocks and Steals also showed a notable
        impact, emphasizing the importance of disruptive defensive play, and
        indicative of the "3-and-D" era where defensive versatility and
        three-point shooting became paramount.  Turnovers, while still
        significant, showed a slight decrease in importance compared to the
        previous decade, aligning with the faster pace and emphasis on offensive
        efficiency.
